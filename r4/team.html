        <p>This digital exhibit – and the overarching Eileen Southern Initiative (ESI) that encompasses it – was developed at Harvard University in 2019-21, beginning just before the disruptions of COVID-19.  Please visit our <a href="about.html">ABOUT PAGE</a> for more about the genesis of the project. Initially, the ESI was conceived as a library-classroom collaboration, which remained the case, even as the scope expanded substantially. Students in an American Studies seminar conducted initial interviews with Southern’s colleagues, as well as her academic progeny, and they undertook preliminary curation of the exhibit. Since then, a dedicated cluster of Harvard students, faculty, and staff has been steadily involved. We are grateful to them all.</p>

        <p>First and foremost, we extend thanks to Katie Callam (Postdoctoral Fellow, Harvard GSAS Fellowships & Writing Center), who was a central force in completing the digital exhibit. Her title was Project Manager, but her position quickly evolved into a fusion of writer, researcher, editor, and IT guru. She was a wizard at working with Omeka, the open-source web platform that provided the exhibit’s IT infrastructure, and she dedicated herself to pursuing long-buried documentation about Southern’s racial and gender struggles.</p>

        <h3 class="team-subhead">We want to single out two members of our core leadership team </h3>

        <p class="title">Braxton D. Shelley</p>
        <p>(formerly of Harvard and currently Associate Professor of Music, of Sacred Music, and of Divinity, Yale University), a steady partner who generously contributed innovative ideas.</p>

        <p class="title">Andrew Clark</p>
        <p>(Director of Choral Activities and Senior Lecturer in Music), who brought this project to Harvard undergraduates, both in the classroom and through the performances of Harvard’s choirs. Andy spearheaded our collaboration with the Aeolians from Oakwood University, an HBCU in Alabama. </p>

        <h3 class="team-subhead">Thanks also go to </h3>

        <h5 class="team-subhead">Harvard student researchers who were central to the digital exhibit</h5>

        <p class="title">Siriana Lundgren</p>
        <p>graduate student in music, who began working on the project as part of the seminar, then continued to contribute substantively. She conducted interviews and served as lead writer and editor for the interactive map of Southern’s correspondence.</p>

        <p class="title">Sharri K. Hall</p>
        <p>graduate student in music, who as a Harvard Library Pforzheimer Fellow conducted a number of interviews, reviewed captions for the oral history interviews, and created metadata for them.</p>

        <p class="title">Eloy Ramirez</p>
        <p>graduate student in music, who researched and drafted the page about Southern’s scholarship on Renaissance music, her initial area of specialization.</p>

        <p class="title">Hannah Ezer (’22)</p>
        <p>joint concentrator in Social Studies & Studies of Women, Gender, & Sexuality, who as an Arts and Humanities SHARP  Fellow processed interviews, created metadata for oral history interviews, edited captions, and helped guide the early design of the website.</p>

        <p class="title">Judith B. Walzer
        <p>Emerita Provost of The New School for Social Research in New York City</p>

At the time of the interview, Walzer was Director of the Office of Women’s Education at Radcliffe College and later Assistant Dean for Coeducation at Harvard College. We are grateful for her initiative and foresight in interviewing the women – only 13 of them – who were then tenured in Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences.</p>
