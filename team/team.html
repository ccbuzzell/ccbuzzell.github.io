        <p>This digital exhibit – and the overarching Eileen Southern Initiative (ESI) – was developed at Harvard University in 2019-21, beginning just before the disruptions of COVID-19.  The project reflects a community-based effort to tell Eileen Southern’s story. </p>

        <p>Initially, the ESI was conceived as a library-classroom collaboration, which remained the case, even as the scope expanded substantially. Students in an American Studies seminar conducted initial interviews with Southern’s colleagues, as well as her academic progeny, and they undertook preliminary curation of the exhibit. Since then, a dedicated cluster of Harvard students, faculty, and staff has been steadily involved. <a href="about.html">Visit our “About” page</a> for more about the ESI’s genesis and its funders.</p>

        <h4 class="team-subhead">Gratitude to all involved in the Eileen Southern Initiative comes from its co-directors</h4>

        <p><b>Christina Linklater</b> Keeper of the Isham Memorial Library, Eda Kuhn Loeb Music Library</p>

        <p><b>Carol J. Oja</b> William Powell Mason Professor of Music and American Studies, and Director of the Humanities Program at the Radcliffe Institute</p>

        <hr>

        <h4 class="team-subhead">We begin with warmest appreciation to Edward Southern, son of Eileen and Joseph Southern, for a series of phone conversations in which we learned a great deal about his mother, her dedication as a scholar and teacher, and her relationship to Harvard. </h4>
        
        <hr>

        <h4 class="team-subhead">Thanks to our core leadership team</h4>

        <p><b>Katie Callam</b> (Postdoctoral Fellow, Harvard GSAS Fellowships & Writing Center), who was a central force in completing the digital exhibit. Her title was Project Manager, but her position quickly evolved into a fusion of writer, researcher, editor, and IT guru. She was a wizard at working with Omeka, the open-source web platform that provided the exhibit’s IT infrastructure, and she dedicated herself to pursuing long-buried documentation about Southern’s racial and gender struggles.</p>

        <p><b>Andrew Clark</b> (Director of Choral Activities and Senior Lecturer in Music), who brought this project to Harvard undergraduates, both in the classroom and through the performances of Harvard’s choirs. Andy spearheaded our collaboration with the Aeolians from Oakwood University, an HBCU in Alabama.</p>

        <p><b>Braxton D. Shelley</b> (formerly of Harvard and currently Associate Professor of Music, of Sacred Music, and of Divinity, Yale University), a steady partner who generously contributed innovative ideas and played a leading role in our webinars.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4 class="team-subhead">Thanks to the Radcliffe Institute, which hosted our webinars and helped support the residency of the Aeolians</h4>

        <p><b>Tomiko Brown-Nagin</b> Dean, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study</p>

        <p><b>Alexander Ferrell Hall</b> Director of Strategic Initiatives, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study</p>

        <p><b>Rebecca Wassarman</b> Executive Director of Academic Ventures and Engagement, Radcliffe Institute</p>

        <hr>

        <h4 class="team-subhead">Thanks to the Division of Arts & Humanities at Harvard, which through Dean Robin Kelsey provided two separate grants in support of the ESI.</h4>
        
        <hr>

        <h4 class="team-subhead">Thanks to Judith B. Walzer, Emerita Provost of The New School for Social Research in New York City, whose extensive 1981 interview with Southern served as a key source for the digital exhibit. </h4>

        <p>At the time of the interview, Walzer was Director of the Office of Women’s Education at Radcliffe College and later Assistant Dean for Coeducation at Harvard College. We are grateful for her initiative and foresight in interviewing the women – only 13 of them at the time – who were tenured in Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences.</p>
        
        <hr>

        <h4 class="team-subhead">Thanks to Harvard student researchers</h4>

        <p><b>Siriana Lundgren</b> graduate student in music, who began working on the project as part of the seminar, then continued to contribute substantively. She conducted interviews and served as lead writer and editor for the interactive map of Southern’s correspondence.</p>

        <p><b>Sharri K. Hall</b> graduate student in music, who as a Harvard Library Pforzheimer Fellow conducted a number of interviews, reviewed captions for the oral history interviews, and created metadata for them.</p>

        <p><b>Eloy Ramirez</b> graduate student in music, who researched and drafted the page about Southern’s scholarship on Renaissance music, her initial area of specialization.</p>

        <p><b>Hannah Ezer (’22)</b> joint concentrator in Social Studies & Studies of Women, Gender, & Sexuality, who as an Arts and Humanities SHARP  Fellow processed interviews, created metadata for oral history interviews, edited captions, and helped guide the early design of the website.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4 class="team-subhead">Thanks to students in a seminar, led by Carol Oja, who initiated the exhibit and the interviews</h4>
